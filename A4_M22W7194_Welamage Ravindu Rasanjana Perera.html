    <p id="south_1">
        Whale and dolphin watching in Mirissa is one of the most exciting water activities you can do during your holiday in Sri Lanka. 
		Often spotted blue whales are the biggest animals in the world and Mirissa is the best place for whale and dolphin watching tours in Sri Lanka. 
		Whale watching season in Mirissa is from November to April..<br><br>

        The best time to go whale watching in Mirissa is from  November to April. Ocean is calm and whales migrate from the southern hemisphare to the northen hemisphere. 
		From May to October is off-season: ocean is rough and it is not worth to go. Chances of spotting whales are very low, chances of getting seasickness very heigh. 
		So please don't send us bookings for off-season.<br><br>

        The chances of spotting whales during November - April are 98%. Keep in your mind that you are going to see wild life so spotting of whales is not 100% guarateed. 
		Blue whales are most often seen. You can see also sperm whales, fin whales, Bryde's whales, short finned whales, dolphins and rarely killer whales and whale shark. 
		Sometimes we pass turtles and flying fish.
